Option 2

How development was assisted:
I modified the prompt given with the lexical definitions for the project. 
Output was pretty good. It assumed comments could be on multiple lines but I didnâ€™t change that. Modified the output messages from testScanner() slightly to make them more readable. 
Modified testScanner() and initScanner() to take in a istream file instead of a string so that the file could be opened in main() rather than the initScanner() function.
